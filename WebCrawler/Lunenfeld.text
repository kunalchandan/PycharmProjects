</span></span></p>, <p>Dr. Bharati Bapat brought her genetics expertise to Mount Sinai
Hospital and the Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute in 1991,
and introduced molecular diagnostics to the team. Today, Mount
Sinai Hospital is a leader in this field, thanks to Dr.
Bapat's work.</p>, <p>In the research lab, Dr. Bapat focuses on uncovering the causes of
colorectal, bladder and prostate cancer by taking an epigenetic
approach. The field of epigenetics examines changes in gene
function that do not disrupt the underlying DNA sequence, but are
instead a reversible change. (Genetics, on the other hand, studies
permanent mutations in genetic function.) DNA methylation is a
naturally occurring process that can cause an impermanent change in a
gene.  </p>, <p>Each tumor is expected to have its own unique pattern or
'signature' of DNA methylation. By studying changes in DNA
methylation, Dr. Bapat aims to generate knowledge that will contribute
to better and more accurate therapies for cancers. One of Dr.
Bapat's new projects involves the use of an innovative profiling
technique to screen the genomes of prostate cancer patients at various
stages of progression. This process will reveal genetic markers to help
pathologists, oncologists and urologists better understand a
patient's prognosis, and ultimately determine optimal treatment on
a case-by-case basis.   </p>, <p>Recently, Dr. Bapat's team conducted a large study of colon
cancer patients from six international registries, in which patients
had one of two distinct genetic types of tumours. Results suggest a
complex interplay between genetic mutations and environmental factors.
Her additional research on the interaction between genes and
environmental influence (specifically, the effects of diet and alcohol)
includes a recent study of 1,000 Canadian patients with colon cancer,
in which changes to the ApoE pathway were investigated. </p>, <p>Another aspect of Dr. Bapat's more recent work focuses on the
development of non-invasive diagnostic tests for cancers. It has
already been proven that DNA methylation tied to prostate cancer can be
detected in a urine sample, which could not only replace the need for
invasive tumour biopsies, but also open the door to a world of
potential in preventative medicine. Dr. Bapat's lab is
already testing urine and blood samples to detect epigenetic signatures
that will avoid (or minimize) some surgical procedures in the future.
The development of more non-invasive tests like this one will transform
the way patients receive care and the way physicians make
diagnoses.</p>, <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum<br/>

Biostatistician and statistical geneticist Dr. Laurent Briollais
develops new statistical methods and designs to study cancer and other
complex human disorders. In particular, he aims to identify the genetic
and environmental factors that cause these diseases in order to improve
prevention and treatment.</span></span></span></p>, <p><span style="font-size: larger"><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span><br/>
With an ever-increasing volume of data generated by large-scale genetic
and genomic studies, Dr. Briollais' team faces important challenges in
order to provide meaningful statistical results that can then be
interpreted by the biologists and lead to critical clinical
applications. Dr. Briollais and his team lend their expertise to
colleagues internationally, and play a critical role in the development
and analysis of large-scale population studies to determine genetic and
environmental factors that contribute to a variety of complex human
diseases.</span></span></span></p>, <p><span style="font-size: larger"><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span><br/>
Within the Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum, Dr. Briollais works with
colleagues to study the genetic susceptibility to breast cancer
that aims to improve our understanding of this disease and to better
predict its risks in the general population. As part of an
interdisciplinary CIHR team grant chaired by Dr. John McLaughlin on the
determinants and impact of colorectal cancer, he is leading a

INVESTIGATOR</span></span></p>, <p>Epithelial ovarian cancer commonly goes undetected, mainly because
symptoms rarely present before the cancer has advanced to a more
aggressive stage. Dr. Thedore Brown is a reproductive endocrine
biologist who was intrigued by the complexity of this disease, the
potential indirect role of reproductive factors, and the need to
improve outcomes for patients.</p>, <p>Dr. Brown is a Senior Investigator at the Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum
Research Institute, and Professor and Head of the Division of
Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility within the University of
Toronto's Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology.</p>, <p>He examines the role steroid hormones play in cancer risk and
progression, with a focus on epithelial ovarian cancer. In order to
develop effective treatments and better diagnostic tests, Dr. Brown is
working to identify markers of early stage disease. In collaboration
with scientists at Mount Sinai Hospital and Princess Margaret Hospital,
Dr. Brown is using gene microarrays to identify the molecular pathways
and genes (including BRCA1/2) associated with ovarian cancer
predisposition and progression.</p>, <p>Dr. Brown is also focused on understanding the function of the
fallopian tube and ovulation in the predisposition to ovarian cancer,
as well as the role of inflammation. A better understanding of
pro-inflammatory genes, specifically those active in the early (or
'luteal') phase of the menstrual cycle, can help identify women at
increased risk of ovarian cancer. Dr. Brown is working with clinical
colleagues at the University Health Network and Mount Sinai Hospital to
assess healthy women and those with the BRCA1 gene (a known risk factor
for ovarian cancer) to determine the role of inflammation in the
fallopian tube.</p>, <p>Through his investigations into a small protein called 'SPARC' and
its known effects on the VEGF pathway (a cellular communication and
signaling pathway linked to the development and progression of cancer),
Dr. Brown and colleagues in the Department of Cell and Systems Biology
at the University of Toronto, the Ontario Cancer Institute and the
University of Guelph, are leading a study in mice to determine the
therapeutic potential of SPARC for women with advanced ovarian
cancer.</p>, <p>In addition to studying ovarian cancer, Dr. Brown collaborates with
colleagues in Mount Sinai Hospital's Centre for Fertility and
Reproductive Health as well as the Murray Koffler Urologic Wellness
Centre, to study cancer originating in other reproductive organs. He
also works with these colleagues in the area of female infertility.</p>, <p> </p>, <p><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0,51,102)">At a

measurements on each person means that studies can be comprehensive and
can generate many new ideas about the underlying biology, but some of
the associations detected will turn out to be 'false lead'. To develop
more sensitive and reliable methods for finding true positive
associations, Dr. Bull uses statistical theory and computational
experiments that require powerful computers. With better methods,
precious research resources for followup studies can be directed to the
'best bets'. </span></span></p>, <p><span style="font-size: larger"><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Guided

</span><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Dr.
Daniel Durocher has focused his considerable talent on investigating
how normal cells become cancer cells. His research is an example of the
potential that drives fundamental research: that a new understanding of
the basic cellular mechanisms involved in cancer, in all
cancers, will revolutionize prevention and treatment of the
disease.</span></span></span></p>, <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span style="font-size: larger"><span>In particular, Dr. Durocher is looking
at how healthy cells detect and repair damage to their DNA. DNA damage
to cells can occur through environmental exposure to sunlight or
smoking, but also occurs regularly through normal metabolic processes
like aging. We know that in healthy cells, this damage is detected and
repaired naturally, but that in cancer this DNA damage response has
failed.</span></span></span></p>, <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span style="font-size: larger"><span>Understanding how healthy cells detect
and repair damage to their DNA will reveal important insights into what
goes wrong in cells that become cancerous. Moreover, discoveries
related to DNA damage will open the door to new, more sophisticated
treatments for the disease: rendering cancer cells more vulnerable to
chemotherapy for example, or developing drugs that can more selectively
target cancerous cells</span></span></span><span style="font-size: larger"><span style="font-family: Arial,Geneva,Helvetica,Helv,sans-serif">.<br/>
</span></span></p>, <p><br/>
<span style="font-size: larger"><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Recently,
Dr. Durocher and his team of researchers at the
Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum discovered the function of a protein that is
vital to the efficient repair of DNA damage.  This protein, called
53BP1, responds to a unique ‘flare’ signal called ubiquitin (another
protein involved in cellular regulation), when there is DNA damage
present and then works together to accelerate the repair process. 53BP1
protects the integrity of DNA by detecting two distinct marks at the
site of DNA damage in the cell, and then helps direct repair of the
damage, resulting in the re-joining of the broken DNA strands. When the
DNA repair system is not functioning optimally in cells, mutations can
go undetected and accumulate, potentially leading to abnormal growth
and, eventually, tumours.</span></span></p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p><span style="color: rgb(0,51,102); font-size: 12pt">At a

</span></span></span></p>, <p>Soft tissue sarcomas (STS) are a diverse group of tumors derived
from connective tissue (muscle, fat and bone).</p>, <p>Current treatment of STS is limited primarily to surgical procedures
(e.g., removing the sarcoma), with selective use of radiation therapy
and the use of conventional chemotherapy in some subtypes of the
disease. Unfortunately, these treatment options are limited in their
effectiveness and more than 50 per cent of STS patients succumb to this
disease.</p>, <p>Researchers have recognized that there is an urgent need to develop
subtype-specific molecularly targeted therapeutics that can provide new
treatment options unique to each histologic type of sarcoma.</p>, <p>Our program has focused on developing novel therapies for:
rhabdomyosarcoma, a tumor mainly found in children and adult sarcomas
including leiomyosarcoma and undifferentiated pleomorphic
sarcoma.<br/>

disease of porous bone, is a major health problem facing our aging
population. Characterized by low bone mass and tissue deterioration,
this disease leads to increased bone fragility and risk of fracture.
Hip fractures are the most common, and the most alarming. In 1993,
there were more than 17,000 osteoporosis-related hip fractures, 50
per cent leading to disability and 20 per cent resulting in death
within a year -- a number that is expected to rise. With one in
four women suffering from osteoporosis, the cost of treating it and its
associated fractures tops more than $1.9 billion in
Canada.</span></span></span></p>, <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span style="font-size: larger">Dr. Marc Grynpas, a Senior Investigator

loss, which ultimately asks the question, 'why do bones break?'
will lead to better treatments and prevention for bone loss and will
develop new therapeutic strategies to prevent bone
fractures.</span></span></p>, <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span style="font-size: larger">One of Dr. Grynpas' research efforts
concentrates on the long-term effect of bisphosphonates, a family
of drugs used to prevent and treat osteoporosis, commonly in

these drugs on bones as well as their therapeutic use to prevent
loosening of hip and knee implants. Building on that, the Grynpas lab
is working to develop new biologic materials to replace current
manufactured implants which have a limited life expectancy due to wear

</span></span></p>, <p>Dr. Andrea Jurisicova, Senior Investigator at
the Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute of Mount Sinai Hospital
and an Associate Professor of Obstetrics and Gynaecology at the
University of Toronto, seeks to improve understanding of the
genetic and biomolecular factors underlying female infertility.</p>, <p>She is using new imaging techniques to explore embryo quality with
the goal of improving the outcome for couples suffering from
infertility.</p>, <p>Dr. Jurisicova trained in Slovakia as an embryologist, and then
completed her graduate and PhD training under Dr. Robert Casper in
Toronto. She conducted post-doctoral research at Harvard Medical
School, and has been working at the Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum since 2007.</p>, <p>That year, in recognition of her past efforts and future promise,
Dr. Jurisicova won a $100,000 federally funded Canada Research Chair,
so she and other Lunenfeld researchers can expand their search for
genes linked to female infertility. Within the next few years, Dr.
Jurisicova hopes to identify genes tied to repeat failures of in vitro
fertilization and, ultimately, boost the success rate of embryo
development for childless couples.</p>, <p>Dr. Jurisicova is also conducting research into how toxins affect a
woman's fertility and that of her offspring. Her research has
showed that when females are exposed to polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons (found in cigarette smoke, car exhaust, fumes from wood
stoves and in charred and smoked foods), the number of eggs in their
offspring's ovaries is reduced by two thirds. In addition, these
compounds can trigger early embryo loss (miscarriage) as well as
retarded embryo growth.</p>, <p>In addition to early embryo development Dr. Jurisicova is also
interested in understanding genetic and environmental pathways that may
trigger premature ovarian failure. She is working to determine how
exposure to radiation therapy impacts the genes determining the fate of
eggs (or oocytes) and how damage to oocytes incurred by radiation can
be prevented, which would ultimately benefit women undergoing radiation
therapy for cancer.</p>, <p>Dr. Jurisicova, in collaboration with Dr. Casper, is investigating
the process of mitochondrial activity in oocytes of older females. By
studying the quality of oocytes (in an animal model) in older versus
younger mothers, they found that mitochondria (the energy-producing
power stations of cells) become less metabolically active with age,
which puts the offspring at greater risk of developing obesity and
metabolic syndrome, and predisposes them to diabetes. However,
administration of coenzyme Q<sub>10</sub> (a vitamin-like substance
found in mitochondria) can reverse the effects of mitochondrial changes
in oocytes, improve fertility, and reduce the risk of chromosomal
abnormalities.</p>, <p>Dr. Jurisicova is working to translate these findings to the clinic
to improve the chance of pregnancy in older women, while preventing
genetic abnormalities including Down syndrome in infants.</p>, <p>Through research using animal models of disease, Dr. Jurisicova
is also investigating abnormalities in the placenta that occur during
embryonic development (which may lead to pre-eclampsia and/or
miscarriages), as well as intrauterine growth restriction. </p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0,51,102)">At a

</span></span>Dr. Julia Knight is a senior investigator, and for over
10 years was the leader of the Prosserman Centre for Health Research,
at the Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute. She is an epidemiologist
and a Professor in the Dalla Lana School of Public Health at the
University of Toronto. </p>, <p>Most of Dr. Knight's work has focused on understanding more about
the causes and development of breast cancer and she played a key role
in the development of the international Breast Cancer Family Registry.
Her current interests include predicting which women with breast cancer
in one breast will go on to develop another cancer in the opposite
breast as part of the international WECARE Study. In particular, she
has shown that women who both smoke cigarettes and drink alcohol are at
higher risk.</p>, <p>She has also shown that breast density, which can be measured on
mammograms done as part of routine follow-up of the opposite breast
after having breast cancer in one breast, could be used to help predict
risk of cancer in the opposite breast, particularly when measured
following treatment.</p>, <p>Studying breast cancer development led her to an interest in
studying breast and other pubertal development in girls. She is part of
the team of investigators that established the LEGACY Girls Study that
includes over 1,000 girls and is following them starting at or before
puberty. The timing of puberty in girls can affect their later health
in a variety of ways including their risk of breast cancer.</p>, <p>Dr. Knight is also studying how factors even earlier in life affect
later health as part of the Ontario Birth Study and is co-leading the
child follow-up component of this study. Finally, Dr. Knight has had a
specific interest in the possible health effects of vitamin D and has
studied the factors that determine a person’s levels of vitamin D.</p>, <p>The main goals of Dr. Knight’s research program are to understand
disease development, particularly breast cancer, for two reasons: one,
to develop ways to prevent disease and promote health early in life;
and two, to be able to predict who is most at risk and likely to
benefit from early prevention and/or screening. </p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0,51,102)">At a

 Hypertension is known as "the silent killer." Hypertension - or
high blood pressure - is the number one risk factor for stroke and a
major cause of heart disease. It affects 20 to 25 per cent of the adult
population, and becomes more common as people age. In people with
diabetes hypertension can lead to kidney failure; it is also linked
to sleep apnea and sleep deprivation.</span></span></span></p>, <p><span style="font-size: larger"><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span>As
a physician, Dr. Alexander Logan sees first-hand the devastating

the Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute, Dr. Logan conducts
research into the causes and treatment of drug-resistant hypertension.
Dr. Logan is employing an innovative approach for determining better
ways to control blood pressure in patients with diabetes. 
Participants are provided with a specially equipped home blood pressure
measuring device and a cell phone, which automatically transmits
readings to the hospital.. The resulting range of readings facilitates
better management of patients' blood pressure.  Good control
could, in the long term, translate into 40% fewer heart attacks and
strokes among diabetes patients with uncontrolled
hypertension.</span></span></span></p>, <p><span style="font-size: larger"><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span>In
a study of sleep apnea and drug-resistant hypertension, Dr. Logan and
his team are assessing the relationship of fluid movement from the legs
during the night and sleep disordered breathing. The concept is novel
and posits that sleep apnea and abnormal sleep patterns are secondary
problems, not the primary, as is generally thought. Their findings may
have significant implications for the management of these related
conditions. He is also an executive member of a team of
investigators assessing the effects of treating sleep apnea in heart
failure patients with a device that is better able to restore normal
breathing pattern.<br/>

spite of significant medical advances in the past forty years, there
has been no reduction in the incidence of preterm birth, even though it
is associated with high newborn death and disease rates and with
significant cognitive and behavioural problems in children and youth.
Moreover, there is now compelling evidence that sub-optimal conditions
for early development and preterm birth are linked with risk of type 2
diabetes, hypertension, obesity and depression in adulthood. A better
understanding of the complex genetic and environmental factors involved
in pregnancy and birth will have a significant impact on Canadian
health care by minimizing neonatal death and disability and improving
lifelong health.</span></span></span></p>, <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span style="font-size: larger">Dr. Stephen Lye is a recognized leader in the
field of women's and infants' health. His research holds
promise for a new understanding of preeclampsia, a leading global cause
of maternal and infant illness and death. In addition, his lab has
conducted pre-clinical trials of a drug to stop uterine contractions,
which is now being tested on patients in preterm labour at Mount Sinai
Hospital.</span></span></p>, <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span style="font-size: larger">He has also developed a diagnostic
test, pilot tested and now part of a larger study, to
distinguish false labour from preterm labour. Once it meets regulatory
approval, this test will have a significant impact on patient care,
preventing unnecessary hospitalization costs and negative impact on
fetal health, since drugs given to stop labour and mature the fetus in
case of pre-term birth can have damaging side effects when, as is often
the case, they are not needed.</span></span></p>, <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span style="font-size: larger">Dr. Lye has also joined a fascinating
Australian study investigating the developmental origins of health and
disease. This project recruited 3,000 pregnant women, recorded their
birth parameters and has followed their offspring for 20 years,
studying a range of factors including growth, physiology, and
psychosocial development. Dr. Lye will be genotyping the children and
the parents, a process that will reveal important data about the
complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors involved in
health and susceptibility to illness.<br/>

</span> <span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"><span>In
June 2005, Dr. Andras Nagy put Canada on the map of stem cell research
by establishing the country's first, and to date only, human
embryonic stem cell lines. On March 1, 2009, Dr. Nagy once again
captured the world's attention with another stem cell research
breakthrough: the discovery of a new non-viral method of creating stem
cells from other cells of the body that could lead to possible cures
for devastating diseases including spinal cord injury, macular
degeneration, diabetes and Parkinson's
disease. </span></span></span></p>, <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: larger">Previous approaches to establish stem cells
from adult cells required the use of viruses to deliver the required
genes, a method that carries the risk of damaging the DNA. Dr.
Nagy's method not only does not require viruses but the stem cell
transgenes necessary for the process of reprogramming can be seamlessly
removed after they created stem cells. Therefore this method overcomes
a major hurdle for the future of safe, personalized stem cell therapies
in humans. Dr. Nagy's new method of generating stem cells does not
require embryos as starting points and could be used to generate cells
from many adult tissues such as a patient's own skin
cells.</span></span></p>, <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: larger">Dr. Nagy's research is a huge step
forward on the path to new stem cell-based therapies and indicates that
researchers at the Lunenfeld are at the leading edge of regenerative
medicine. Regenerative medicine enables the human body to repair,
replace, restore and regenerate its own damaged or diseased cells,
tissues and organs.</span></span></p>, <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: larger">Joining Mount Sinai Hospital in 1988, Dr.
Nagy has been involved in mouse embryonic stem cell research since its
early days. His research resulted in an important development in cancer
research in 1996 that provided a new tool for researchers and
pharmaceutical companies to test new and existing treatments for
cancer.</span></span></p>, <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: larger">Dr. Nagy has developed a broad spectrum of
genomic technologies now used around the world. These technologies
assist the study of gene function in development and disease, and are
important tools in the development of stem cell based therapies. By
using technologies to direct gene expression, scientists will gain
control of stem cell behaviour, propagation and
differentiation, which will be essential if stem cells are to be
used to treat human disease.<br/>
</span></span></p>, <p><span style="font-size: larger"><br/>
 With respect to future clinical use of these stem cells, the existence
of mutant cells still introduces a significant risk of unexpected
behaviour after cell transplantation, including the possibility of
cancer formation. Recently, Dr. Nagy and his team found that  the
early phase of the reprogramming process for induced Pluripotent
Stem (iPS) cells is the root cause of acquired
mutations.  Dr. Nagy and his lab are currently trying to
protect the integrity of the genomic DNA of iPS cells during the
reprogramming process by ensuring the safety of stem-cell-based
therapies before they can be brought to clinical therapies and
treatments. </span></p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0,51,102)">At a

Nagy laboratory is interested in using mouse genetics to study
mammalian development and to apply this knowledge to human disease. Dr.
Nagy is also developing new, powerful tools for genetic approaches and
phenotype analysis for these ongoing studies. More recently he became
interested in the biology of human pluripotent stem cells, such as
embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem
cells.</span></span></p>, <p> </p>, <p><a href="http://contact.mshri.on.ca/publications/?pageNum=1&amp;r=20&amp;t=&amp;e=0&amp;au=Nagy" target="_blank">

</span></span></p>, <p>Dr. Frederick (Fritz) Roth is an inaugural Canada Excellence
Research Chair in Integrative Biology and a Senior Investigator at the
Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute. Known worldwide for his work in
computational biology and genomics, Dr. Roth is jointly appointed at
the University of Toronto's Terrence Donnelly Centre for Cellular
and Biomolecular Research.</p>, <p>Dr. Roth completed his PhD in biophysics at Harvard University in
1998, after studying both physics and molecular and cell biology at the
University of California, Berkeley. His most recent position before
joining the Lunenfeld was at Harvard Medical School, where he was an
Associate Professor in the Department of Biological Chemistry and
Molecular Pharmacology.</p>, <p>His research focuses on developing technologies to more efficiently
relate genes to the functioning of living systems and human diseases.
These new technologies will accelerate researchers' studies of
genes, their functions and how these functions interact to form living
systems.</p>, <p>Building on their previous work in experimental and computational
genomics, Dr. Roth's team will collaborate with other Lunenfeld
researchers in the Systems Biology group to develop new technologies
for revealing gene functions, the pathways they encode and how these
genes and pathways are related to human diseases. Dr. Roth's group
is harnessing â€œnext generationâ€ DNA sequencing technologies to
systematically measure the effects of multiple genetic changes, and to
map protein interactions.</p>, <p>Large-scale experimentation on biological model systems by Dr. Roth
and others in the Systems Biology group is uncovering fundamental
aspects of protein, cell and organismal function to better understand
human health and disease.</p>, <p>Early work by Dr. Roth demonstrated that DNA sequence elements
controlling genes can be automatically discovered using large-scale
measurements of the levels at which genes are activated.</p>, <p>His group has extensively studied the networks of interactions
between proteins in yeast, worms, plants and humans. More
recently, Dr. Roth's team has computationally prioritized
candidate disease genes so that researchers can focus efforts on the
genes most likely to impact human health.</p>, <p> </p>, <p><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0,51,102)">At a

</span><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Structural
biologist Dr. Frank Sicheri is widely regarded as one of
Canada's pre-eminent scientists in his field. He has made
outstanding contributions to our understanding of the structure and
function of a number of molecules, many of which are implicated in
disease. His research is focused on cancer, but he has a number of
projects involving molecules involved in viral infection and diabetes.
His discoveries are critical to the development of new drugs that
target these diseases.</span></span></span></p>, <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span style="font-size: larger"><span>In particular, Dr. Sicheri studies a
family of enzymes called protein kinases. The human genome encodes
approximately 500 protein kinases. These molecules act as switches
within cells that regulate numerous biological processes. Malfunction
of protein kinases, which can happen as a result of genetic
mutation or damage from a virus, gives rise to cellular
dysfunctions that underlie numerous diseases. One common example is
cancer, in which malfunctioning kinases cause cells to grow and
multiply uncontrollably.</span></span></span></p>, <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span style="font-size: larger"><span>Scientists have found that the activity
of protein kinases can be inhibited with specific molecules. As a
result kinases have become an important focus by pharmaceutical
companies in the development of new drugs. Drugs which inhibit specific
kinases are already being used successfully to treat chronic myeloid
leukemia (Gleevac), and some forms of lung cancer
(Iressa).</span></span></span></p>, <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span style="font-size: larger"><span>To date however, only a fraction of the
protein kinases encoded in the human genome have been explored. Dr.
Sicheri's research is directed at improving our understanding of
how protein kinases work, and at defining the structure and function of
new kinases in order to unlock their potential as drug targets for
disease. He has made a number of important discoveries in this area,
including solving the structure of a kinase known to be active in colon
cancer, and another that suppresses tumour formation.<br/>

<br/>
</span></span></p>, <p><span style="font-size: larger">After graduating from the University
of Toronto, Faculty of Medicine in 1992, Dr. Mark Silverberg completed
his internal medicine and gastroenterology training in Toronto in 1997.
He then obtained a PhD studying the genetics of inflammatory bowel
disease in 2002 at the Samuel Lunenfeld Research Institute of Mount
Sinai Hospital. He is currently a Professor and Clinician Scientist in
the Department of Medicine and holds the Gale and Graham Wright
Research Chair in Digestive Diseases. He runs a laboratory based at
Mount Sinai Hospital and the Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute
investigating the causes of inflammatory bowel disease
(IBD).</span></p>, <p>His research program has been funded by grants from the National
Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK/NIH),
Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR), Crohn's and Colitis
Canada (CCC) and the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America (CCFA).
His laboratory has focused on identifying susceptibility genes for IBD
and to explain the contribution of genes and other biomarkers to its
etiology and clinical course.</p>, <p>More recently he has expanded his program to study the relationship
between serum immune responses, gene regulation and the host microbiome
with genetic susceptibility. He has made significant contributions to
the discovery of genes related to Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis
and paediatric IBD. He also has made major contributions to clinical
IBD research in the field of phenomics, classification of IBD (The
Montreal Classification) and as well as in optimal use of biologic
therapy and therapeutic drug monitoring.</p>, <p>Dr. Silverberg has taken leadership positions on several
international collaborative efforts with the goal of expediting
scientific progress in the field of IBD. These include the
International IBD Genetics Consortium, the NIDDK IBD Genetics
Consortium and the CCFA Microbiome Initiative. Dr. Silverberg is also
currently the Director of the Advanced IBD Fellowship Program at MSH
and co-director of the Canadian GI Fellows Program in IBD.</p>, <p>His current projects are directed toward understanding the
relationship between the microbiome in the digestive tract and host
genotype allowing more insight into the role of diet and how food may
trigger or exacerbate IBD. Ultimately he hopes to develop tools that
will allow clinicians to better predict who may develop IBD and to
identify high-risk patients so that a more personalized approach to
treatment based on patients' unique genetic and bacterial signatures
may be employed. Dr. Silverberg also runs a large clinical practice
focused on IBD at Mount Sinai Hospital.</p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0,51,102)">At a

Senior Investigator Dr. Jeff Wrana is internationally recognized for
his cancer research. While most current cancer investigations focus on
specific disease pathways, Dr. Wrana believes cancer involves a complex
network of pathways that work together to misregulate cells and cause
disease. His research aims to expose the mechanisms involved in the
development of these networks and to reveal new targets for treatments
that would attack the entire disease network, not just individual
hubs.</span></span></span></p>, <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span style="font-size: larger"><span>Dr. Wrana's research program
involves the application of high-throughput, robotics-based
technologies that perform thousands of tests at a time and enable
studies of gene function on a genome-wide scale. With his special
expertise and phenomenal success securing support from granting
agencies, he has established a Robotics Facility at the
Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute. The expertise and advanced
technology available in the facility extends the research capacity of
scientists throughout the Lunenfeld and
beyond.</span></span></span></p>, <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span style="font-size: larger"><span>In February 2009, Dr. Wrana unveiled a
new technology tool that analyzes breast cancer tumours to determine a
patient's best treatment options. The technology, called
DyNeMo, analyzes networks of proteins in cancer cells, and can
predict with more than 80 per cent accuracy a patient's chance of
recovering from breast cancer. Wrana and his team hope that the
technology will eventually provide individualized analysis to breast
cancer patients and their oncologists so that they are better informed
and empowered to select a treatment best suited to
them.</span></span></span></p>, <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span style="font-size: larger"><span>Dr. Wrana has also made significant
discoveries related to colorectal and other cancers. In particular, he
is interested in metastasis, the spread of cancer from its initial
site to other places throughout the body, and which is responsible
for 90 percent of cancer deaths. Insights into this little-understood
process have the potential to make a significant impact on survival
rates for breast and other cancers.<br/>

</p>, <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span style="font-size: larger"><span>In December 2012, Dr. Wrana
and his team garnered media attention for their major discovery
about the way cancer spreads. The team found that proteins produced in
normal cells near the environment of a cancer tumour influence the
cancer’s ability to spread to other tissues of the body. This alters
the standard thought that cancer cells were responsible for cancer
spreading, and this discovery has the potential to transform the
way cancer is treated.</span></span></span></p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0,51,102)">At a

Wrana's lab is primarily interested in defining the signal transduction
pathways for a superfamily of proteins known as TGF-beta. Dr. Wrana's
lab has defined some of the key steps in this pathway and determined
that Smad2 is mutated in some colorectal cancers. Recently, the lab
identified SARA (for Smad Anchor for Receptor Activation). The
biological function of SARA is currently being elucidated using a
knockout mouse of SARA.</span></span></span></p>, <p>  </p>, <p><a href="http://contact.mshri.on.ca/blueBook/?mcQuery=Wrana" target="_blank"><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0,51,102)">Recent

</span> <span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span>When
neurons form synapses to communicate with each other, the wiring for
our sensory, motor, and cognitive experience is formed. Dr. Mei Zhen is
studying how synapses form in the nervous system, the wiring of
the brain that makes us who we are. Her goal is a breakthrough in
understanding brain development, synapse formation, and how to treat
the brain when it is diseased or damaged.</span></span></span></p>, <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span style="font-size: larger"><br/>
 Dr. Zhen's research has implications for a vast range of diseases
including psychiatric disorders like schizophrenia, depression and
bi-polar disorder, neurodegenerative diseases like ALS, and genetic
disorders related to development of the nervous system. To date, the
biochemical mechanisms responsible for synapse formation are still not
well understood, in large part because of the size and complexity of
the nervous system. In order to study synapse formation Dr. Zhen uses
an innovative research model, a small roundworm called C. elegans â€“
that has fewer than ten thousand synapses compared to the estimated
1014 to 1015  (that's a quadrillion) synapses in the adult
human brain.</span></span></p>, <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span style="font-size: larger"><br/>
 Dr. Zhen has shown that, in spite of the vast difference in
complexity, the human and C. elegans are likely to use similar sets of
genes to make synapses. Her innovative approach has provided much more
information than earlier methods of studying synapses, which called for
a labour-intensive preparation of animal samples to be studied with an
electron microscope. </span></span></p>, <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> </span></p>, <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span style="font-size: larger">Dr. Zhen's lab is at the forefront of
