So far Tic-Tac-Toe is the only game I've written in Python. I've written this to be as short as possible doing the bare minimum in evrything. However this can be easily extended to a 4x4 or nxn board by specifiying in the board width and height. the game should compensate for that. I haven't tested it because I'm lazy but I'm confident it will work.
*Controls*
You specify the spot you would like to place your number based on it's index if the array was flattened.
It should be like:
0	1	2
3	4	5
6	7	8
for a 3x3 board
